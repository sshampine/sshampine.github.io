		<p>My interest in computers started in the fourth grade. The school had a TRS-80 that was shared between all classes. My fifth grade teacher purchased two TI-99/4a computers out of her own pocket for her class. I guess she saw I was interested in them and made me their 'gatekeeper'. Mrs. Cook saw the sys admin in me. My first program was in BASIC and printed Hello! on the screen.</p>
			<div class="basic">
				<p>&#62;10 print "Hello!"</p>
				<p>&#62;20 goto 10</p>
			</div>
		<p>Now I'm a full-fledged system administrator who maintains corporate server and storage infrastructure. I'm ready for a change though. Typing in strange, colorful commands on a keyboard and making things appear on the screen is clever. Much more clever than <a href="https://youtu.be/t2F1rFmyQmY" target="_blank">turning a computer off then turning it back on again.</a></p>
